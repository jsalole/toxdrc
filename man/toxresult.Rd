\subsection{\code{RTgill}}{

A data frame with 1,080 rows and 7 columns:
\describe{
\item{TestID}{Combination of Test_Number, Dye, Type, and Replicate}
\item{Test_Number}{Identifying number of each effluent sample}
\item{Conc}{Concentration of reference toxicant (3,4 dichloranaline). 0 is solvent control, "control" is a lab control}
\item{RFU}{Fluoresence produced as determined by a plate reader}
\item{Dye}{Three cell viability indicators; aB = alamarBlue, CFDA = 5-CFDA-AM, NR = Neutral Red}
\item{Type}{Only spiked exists in this dataset; indicated a reference toxicant was added to the effluent.}
\item{Replicate}{The experimental replicate; replication occured at a well-plate level.}

\description{
A subset of data from a study using the RTgill-W1 assay (ISO 21115/OECD 249). Briefly, cells are exposed to a toxicant and the fluorescent signal is measured using 3 indicators.
